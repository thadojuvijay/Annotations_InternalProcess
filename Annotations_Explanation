/*
*when we run the cone class jvm cannot process/understand the MyAnnotationone or MyAnnootation2.
*when we use our own Annoatations we should develop extra classes to process the Annotation by JVM.

i developed a extra class with name MyApp class.
once saw that  MyApp class.you will get clarity and  @Retention will used by at Runtime by jvm

we use reflection Api to process Annotations.
when we supply a class as input to Reflection Api it will displays all information about the class(method,constructors etc..)

*ide developers and jvm developers will uses reflection Api.

we internally use reflection Api to get annotation elements from top of the  calss,
		top of the methods,top of the fields.top of the package level.
		
		* in the java.lang.reflect package we have Interface AnnotatedElement.
		in that AnnotatedElement interface. we have one method with name getAnnotation()
		 Annotation[]	getAnnotations()
         Returns annotations that are present on this element.
         * By using this method we can see annotation elements on the top of the
         field,Class, Constructor, Executable, Field, Method,
          Package, Parameter.
          
      if you want to use that method.we need implementation of that Interface AnnotatedElement.
       All Known Implementing Classes of AnnotatedElement:
AccessibleObject, Class, Constructor, Executable, Field, Method, Package, Parameter.

if the class,constructor,Executable, Field, Method, Package, Parameter have implementation of
 AnnotatedElement interface then we have the method           
                           getAnnotation();
       By using this method we can see all annotation elements on top of the class,constructor,
       Executable, Field, Method, Package, Parameter.
                create object of class and object of method,object of constructor
                to use the getAnnotation();
                 this is why we use reflection Api internally.
         
                                  
                                  Example of why we use @Target and @Retention
         
         
         import java.lang.annotation.ElementType;
import java.lang.annotation.Retention;
import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;
import java.lang.annotation.Target;

@Target({ElementType.TYPE,ElementType.METHOD})
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface MyAnnotationTwo 

{
public String name();
}

/* 
 *Why we use @Target?
 *we use target for Which type(class,Method,field) you want to give more information,
 *By targeting the Element.TYPE we give more information at class level,
 *By targeting the Element.METHOD we give more information at METHOD level,
 *
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * */



/* The jvm will not understand the custom Annotations.which made by programmer.
 * if the jvm want to understand our custom  Annotation then we use 
 * @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)

 * java.lang.annotation
